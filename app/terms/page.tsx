          <strong>How It Works:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '10px' }}>
          We send a single initial informational text message to property owners identified through
          public county records. This message identifies our business, explains why we are contacting
          you, and includes opt-out instructions. If you wish to receive additional communications
          about your potential claim, reply <strong>YES</strong>. No further messages are sent unless
          you reply YES, which constitutes your express consent. You may opt out at any time.
        </p>

          <strong>Consent:</strong>
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '10px' }}>
          By replying <strong>YES</strong> to our initial message, you provide express consent to
          receive additional informational SMS messages from MaxSam Recovery Services about unclaimed
          funds and property services. Consent is not a condition of any purchase or service. You may

        5. Fees and Payment
      </h3>
      <p>
        For excess-funds recovery, we charge a contingency fee of 25% of the recovered amount,
        payable only upon successful recovery. For distressed-property solutions, fees are agreed
        upon in writing prior to service commencement. There is no upfront cost for initial
        consultations or eligibility assessments.

      </h3>
      <p>
        While we make reasonable efforts to assist with excess-funds recovery and distressed-property
        solutions, we do not guarantee any particular outcome. Recovery depends on claim validity,
        court processes, and other factors outside our control. Information provided via SMS or other
        communications is for informational purposes and does not constitute legal or financial
        advice.
