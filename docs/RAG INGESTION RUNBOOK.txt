# RAG INGESTION RUNBOOK

## Daily Ingestion (minimum)
1) Pull latest main
2) Re-index corpus folders:
   - docs/
   - sql/
   - workflows/
   - scripts/
3) Store ingestion metadata:
   - commit sha
   - file list
   - chunk counts
   - timestamp

## Chunking Guidance
- Markdown: split by headings
- JSON: split by node blocks (n8n) or major keys
- SQL: split by table/function blocks

## Required “Do Not Index”
- .env
- secrets
- tokens
- private keys

## Verification Query (smoke test)
Ask the RAG:
- “What is the deploy precondition?”
Expected:
- citation to docs/MCP/MCP_DEPLOYER_RULES.md
- explicit mention of CI green requirement
