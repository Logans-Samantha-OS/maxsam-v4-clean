# How to Change MaxSam Safely

## Rule Zero
Never change `main` directly.

---

## Safe Change Procedure

1. Create a new branch
2. Make changes
3. Commit with a clear message
4. Open a Pull Request into `main`
5. Review changes
6. Merge
7. Delete branch

---

## What Goes in a Branch

- New logic
- New documents
- Experiments
- Refactors

---

## What Goes in `main`

Only merged, reviewed, governance-compliant artifacts.

---

## If Something Feels Wrong

Stop.
Do not commit.
Do not merge.

Review:
- Branch
- Diff
- Governance rules

---

## Emergency Recovery

If a mistake enters `main`:
- Revert via PR
- Never force-push
- Never rewrite history
