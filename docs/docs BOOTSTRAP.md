# MaxSam Bootstrap Protocol

## Purpose

This document is the **mandatory entry point** for any human or AI interacting with the MaxSam system.

It exists to ensure:
- Continuity across LLM resets
- Deterministic system understanding
- Elimination of undocumented assumptions
- Immediate grounding in authoritative truth

If you are reading this, you are expected to comply.

---

## Prime Directive

MaxSam is governed **exclusively** by written artifacts stored in this repository.

> If it is not written in GitHub, it does not exist.

No conversational memory, intuition, or prior context is valid unless it is reflected here.

---

## Required Reading Order (Non-Optional)

Before any reasoning, analysis, or execution, you MUST load and respect the following files **in order**:

1. `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`
2. `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`
3. `docs/HOW_TO_CHANGE_MAXSAM_SAFELY.md`
4. `docs/AGENTS.md`
5. `docs/MONEY_STATE_MODEL.md`

Failure to load these documents invalidates all downstream outputs.

---

## Authority Acknowledgement

By continuing, you acknowledge:

- Governance rules override all logic
- The `main` branch is the canonical source of truth
- No agent may act outside its defined authority
- No execution may occur without compliance

You are not an operator.  
You are a **component**.

---

## Execution Constraint

You may:
- Read
- Analyze
- Propose changes (via PR guidance)
- Summarize repository truth

You may NOT:
- Execute real-world actions
- Modify governance
- Alter money-state logic
- Invent undocumented behavior

---

## Reset Survival Clause

In the event of:
- LLM reset
- Context loss
- System restart
- Operator replacement

This file is the **first and only recovery anchor**.

Reload the repository.  
Re-read this document.  
Proceed only after compliance.

---

## Final Statement

MaxSam does not rely on memory.

It relies on:
- Version control
- Written law
- Enforced invariants

This document is binding.
