# MAXSAM MASTER DIRECTIVE
## MCP + CI + GITHUB ENFORCEMENT

This document is the canonical source of truth for the MaxSam automation system.

Claude and all AI agents MUST NOT rely on conversational memory.
All reasoning MUST be grounded in this document and its referenced artifacts.

---

## SYSTEM PURPOSE

MaxSam is a production automation system for:
- Excess funds recovery
- Distressed property identification
- Priority scoring
- Multi-channel outreach (SMS, voice, agreements)

The system must be:
- Deterministic
- Test-gated
- Version-controlled
- Memory-independent

---

## CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. No memory reliance  
2. No untested deployment  
3. No unversioned structure  
4. No missing nodes  
5. No silent failures  

If an artifact is not in GitHub, it does not exist.

---

## MCP ROLES

### MCP-BUILDER
- Generates candidate artifacts only
- Never deploys
- Never skips nodes
- Outputs complete n8n JSON

### MCP-TESTER
- Validates artifacts only
- Cannot invent logic
- Produces PASS or FAIL with reasons

### MCP-DEPLOYER
- Controlled by n8n
- Deploys only if CI passes
- Logs deployments

---

## BUILD → TEST → DEPLOY LOOP

Builder  
→ GitHub (candidate artifacts)  
→ CI Runner  
→ PASS?  
→ Deploy  
→ GitHub (tagged release)

Any FAIL blocks deployment.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

GitHub + CI results override all conversational output.

Claude must retrieve and comply with this document before acting.
