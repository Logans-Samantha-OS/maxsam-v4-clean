# MAXSAM MASTER DIRECTIVE
## MCP + CI + GITHUB ENFORCEMENT

This document is the canonical source of truth for the MaxSam automation system.

All AI agents MUST NOT rely on conversational memory.
All reasoning MUST be grounded in this repository and its referenced artifacts.

If an artifact is not in GitHub, it does not exist.

---

## SYSTEM PURPOSE

MaxSam is a production automation system for:
- Excess funds recovery
- Distressed property identification
- Priority scoring
- Multi-channel outreach (SMS, voice, agreements)

The system must be:
- Deterministic
- Test-gated
- Version-controlled
- Memory-independent

---

## CORE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. No memory reliance
2. No untested deployment
3. No unversioned structure
4. No missing nodes
5. No silent failures

---

## BUILD → TEST → DEPLOY LOOP

MCP-BUILDER → GitHub (candidate) → CI Runner → PASS? → MCP-DEPLOYER → Deploy → GitHub Tag

Any FAIL blocks deployment.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

GitHub + CI results override all conversational output.
No agent is permitted to “hotfix” production without passing the loop above.

- workflows/mcp/regression-test-runner.json

### CI enforcement

## RAG REQUIREMENT (STARTING POINT)

MaxSam must treat this repo as the primary corpus.
The RAG layer must index:
- /docs
- /sql
- /workflows
- key config artifacts

RAG must return:
- citations (file paths + sections)
- version identifiers (commit sha / tag)
- confidence boundaries

See:
- docs/RAG/RAG_SYSTEM_SPEC.md
- docs/RAG/RAG_INGESTION_RUNBOOK.md
