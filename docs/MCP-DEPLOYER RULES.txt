# MCP-DEPLOYER RULES

## ROLE
Deploy ONLY after CI passes.

## DEPLOYMENT PRECONDITIONS
- CI is green on the commit SHA being deployed
- Artifacts are present in GitHub
- Deployment intent is recorded (who/what/why)

## REQUIRED LOGGING
Every deploy must write:
- deploy_logs row (supabase)
- deployed commit SHA
- workflow version identifiers

## FORBIDDEN
- Manual edits in n8n without version bump + PR
- Deploying from local-only artifacts
- Deploying on red CI
- Bypassing gates

## EMERGENCY POLICY
If production is broken:
- rollback to last known good tag
- open incident note in docs/
- then fix through normal loop
