## OVERVIEW

When a foreclosed property sells at auction for more than the outstanding debt, the difference constitutes "excess proceeds" or "surplus funds." Under Texas law, these funds belong to the former property owner or lienholders, not the taxing entities. Texas Tax Code Section 34.04 governs the claims process for these funds.

## DEADLINE TO FILE CLAIM

| Foreclosure Type | Deadline |
|------------------|----------|
| **Tax Foreclosure** | 2 years from sale date |
| **Mortgage Foreclosure** | Generally 3 years from sale date |

**WARNING:** Missing the deadline = funds are forfeited to taxing units as a windfall.

## WHO CAN CLAIM EXCESS FUNDS

1. **Former property owners** who lost property in the tax sale
2. **Lienholders** with a recorded financial interest in the property
3. **Heirs** of the former owner (with proof of relationship)
