CHANGE CONTROL

## RULE: Everything flows through PRs
- No direct commits to main (prefer branch protection)
- PRs must reference affected artifacts
- PR must state risk level: LOW / MED / HIGH

## RISK LEVELS
LOW: docs only, no runtime
MED: workflows or minor logic
HIGH: outbound comms, money movement, claims

## REQUIRED FOR HIGH RISK
- explicit test plan
- rollback plan
- reviewer approval (even if reviewer is you, treat as a checklist)
