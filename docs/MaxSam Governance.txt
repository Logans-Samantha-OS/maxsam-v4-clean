MaxSam Governance
Purpose

This document defines how the MaxSam system is governed, changed, and trusted.

It exists to ensure that:

System behavior is deterministic

Money, authority, and execution are auditable

No agent, workflow, or human action can bypass defined rules

The system can evolve without losing integrity

If a rule is not written here or explicitly referenced by this repository, it does not exist.

Authority Hierarchy

This document defines the binding governance rules for the MaxSam system.

Order of authority (highest to lowest):

GOVERNANCE.md

System Constitution

main branch artifacts

Agent logic and workflows

Experimental or feature branches

No system component may violate governance rules.

Canonical Source of Truth

The main branch is canonical

All production behavior is defined by artifacts in main

No agent may rely on conversational memory or undocumented logic

If it’s not in GitHub, it doesn’t exist.

In the event of conflict:

Governance overrides implementation

Constitution overrides code

main overrides branches

Change Control

All changes to MaxSam MUST:

Be made on a non-main branch

Be reviewed via Pull Request

Be merged into main to become authoritative

Direct commits to main are prohibited for governed changes.

Branching Policy
Default State

All normal work occurs on main

main is always deployable, readable, and authoritative

You do not toggle branches casually.

When a Branch Is Required

A new branch must be created for changes that affect:

System invariants

Money-state definitions

Agreement templates

ORION decision authority

Intake schemas that affect money or execution

Enforcement logic or guardrails

These are considered constitutional changes.

Required flow:

Branch from main

Make changes

Open a Pull Request

Review intent and system-level impact

Merge into main

Delete the branch

No exceptions.

When a Branch Is NOT Required

Branches are not required for:

County data additions

PDFs or source documents

Research notes

Operational runbooks

Dashboards

Non-authoritative n8n workflows

These may be committed directly to main.

Pull Request Policy

Pull Requests represent changes to law, not experiments.

Every PR must:

Clearly state intent

Describe system-level impact

Be mergeable without ambiguity

Once merged:

The change is binding

Agents must comply

Rollbacks require a new PR

Agent Authority Model
ORION

Final gatekeeper for execution

Enforces allowed actions

Validates money-state transitions

Cannot be bypassed

SAM

Executes outreach and interaction

May propose actions

Cannot change money-state or execute without ORION approval

ELEANOR

Produces analysis and scoring

No execution authority

ALEX

Provides grounded knowledge retrieval

No execution authority

Money-State Governance

Every lead exists in exactly one money-state

States are immutable except via valid transitions

Transitions are enforced by ORION and database constraints

All changes are append-only and logged

If you cannot answer:

“Where is the money stuck?”

in under 10 seconds, the system is wrong.

Memory and Intelligence Rules

The system does not rely on conversational memory

Intelligence must be encoded as:

Documents

Schemas

Rules

SQL

Workflow definitions

Human understanding is optional. Repository truth is mandatory.

CI / Deployment Signals

CI or deployment failures do not invalidate governance changes

Governance artifacts may exist independently of deployable applications

Infrastructure errors do not override system law

Rollback and Change Control

No direct rollback of main

Corrections require:

New branch

New PR

Explicit justification

History is preserved. Authority is versioned.

Final Principle

MaxSam is not operated by memory, habit, or intuition.

It is operated by:

Written rules

Version control

Enforced invariants

This document is binding.
