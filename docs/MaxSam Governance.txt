# MaxSam Governance

## Authority Hierarchy

This document defines the binding governance rules for the MaxSam system.

Order of authority (highest to lowest):

1. GOVERNANCE.md
2. System Constitution
3. Main branch artifacts
4. Agent logic and workflows
5. Experimental or feature branches

No system component may violate governance rules.

---

## Change Control

All changes to MaxSam MUST:

- Be made on a non-main branch
- Be reviewed via Pull Request
- Be merged into `main` to become authoritative

Direct commits to `main` are prohibited.

---

## Canonical Source of Truth

The `main` branch represents the authoritative state of the system.

If a conflict exists:
- Governance overrides implementation
- Constitution overrides code
- Main overrides branches

---

## Agent Compliance

No agent (AI or human) may:
- Bypass governance
- Modify governance without a PR
- Execute logic that contradicts governance artifacts

---

## Enforcement

Violations invalidate downstream logic and outputs.
