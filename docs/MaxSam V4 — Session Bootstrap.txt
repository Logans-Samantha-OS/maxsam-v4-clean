# MaxSam V4 — Session Bootstrap

## 1. What This System Is
MaxSam V4 is a modular convergence engine that automates:
- Excess funds recovery
- Distressed property acquisition
- Lead qualification
- Outreach and deal routing

It is designed to later generalize into other domains
(health, fitness, finance, relationships, time allocation).

## 2. Core Agents (Non-Negotiable)
- **ALEX** — Knowledge + Memory Layer  
  - NotebookLM-style ingestion
  - Chunking, embeddings, retrieval
  - Exposed via HTTP API (`/query`, `/add`, etc.)

- **ELEANOR** — Scoring + Analysis  
  - Lead scoring
  - Pattern recognition
  - Uses ALEX for grounded context

- **SAM** — Conversational Lead Qualification Persona  
  - SMS + phone outreach
  - Context-aware
  - No promises, no fees, compliance-safe

- **ORION** — Decision Router  
  - Determines next action:
    skip trace, SMS, escalate, reject

---

## 3. Current State (FACTS)
- n8n Cloud is used for orchestration
- Supabase + pgvector is used for storage
- ALEX HTTP API exists locally (FastAPI)
- NotebookLM is currently manual (45 sources)
- Goal: fully replace NotebookLM with ALEX + n8n

---

## 4. Golden Lead Definition
A **Golden Lead** is:
- A person who appears on BOTH:
  - Excess funds list
  - Distressed property list

These are highest-priority leads.

---

## 5. Architecture Direction
- NotebookLM → automated via ALEX
- n8n calls ALEX `/query` at key decision points
- Context is injected into LLM calls (Claude/Gemini)
- Learning loops feed results back into ALEX

---

## 6. What Is NOT Done Yet
- No Railway/Render deployment yet
- No permanent repo integration of ALEX yet
- n8n workflows are being generated next
- Interface contracts still being frozen

---

## 7. Hard Rules
- Do not over-design
- Keep everything readable
- Modular over monolithic
- No single-file “god objects”
- Validate locally before deploying

---

## 8. Immediate Next Objective
Create and validate:
1. Local ALEX API testing
2. n8n workflows that call `/query`
3. Minimal repo integration plan
